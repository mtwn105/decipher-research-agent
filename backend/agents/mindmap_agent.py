        Analyze the research content and identify hierarchical themes with appropriate depth (up to 5 levels):

        - Level 1: ONE main central topic/theme (the overarching subject)
        - Level 2: Primary categories under the main topic (3-6 major categories)
        - Level 3: Secondary subtopics under each category (2-5 per category)
        - Level 4: Detailed aspects (if content warrants it, 2-4 per subtopic)
        - Level 5: Specific details (only if highly detailed content, 1-3 per aspect)

        Research Content:
        ```
        {research}
        ```

        Determine the appropriate depth based on content complexity:
        - Simple content: 2-3 levels
        - Moderate content: 3-4 levels
        - Complex content: 4-5 levels

        Create a hierarchical breakdown with:
        - ONE main topic at the root level that encompasses the entire research
        - Concise labels (1-4 words each)
        - Logical grouping of related concepts under the main topic
        - Appropriate depth based on content richness
        - Clear parent-child relationships

    create_mindmap_task = Task(
        description="""
        Create the final mindmap structure using the hierarchical breakdown from the content analysis.

        Generate a hierarchical node structure where:
        - Root node has id="root", text content, display={"block": true}, and nodes array
        - Each child node has a unique id (like "1", "2", "3", etc.), text content, and nodes array
        - Empty nodes arrays [] represent leaf nodes (no children)
        - Structure depth adapts to content complexity (2-5 levels)
        - Start with ONE main topic that encompasses all the research content

        You must create the structure in the "mindmap" field with this exact format:
        {
            "mindmap": {
                "id": "root",
                "text": "Main Research Topic",
                "display": {"block": true},
                "nodes": [
                    {
                        "id": "1",
                        "text": "Category A",
                        "nodes": [
                            {
                                "id": "2",
                                "text": "Subtopic 1",
                                "nodes": []
                            },
                            {
                                "id": "3",
                                "text": "Subtopic 2",
                                "nodes": []
                            }
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "4",
                        "text": "Category B",
                        "nodes": [
                            {
                                "id": "5",
                                "text": "Subtopic 3",
                                "nodes": []
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            "title": "Research Topic Title",
            "description": "Brief description"
        }

        Structure guidelines:
        - Root level: ONE main topic (the central theme of all research)
        - Level 1: Primary categories under the main topic (3-6 categories)
        - Level 2: Secondary subtopics under each category (2-5 per category)
        - Level 3: Detailed aspects (if needed, 2-4 per subtopic)
        - Level 4: Specific details (if highly detailed, 1-3 per aspect)

        Rules:
        - Use the exact hierarchical node structure shown above
        - Root node must have id="root" and display={"block": true}
        - All other nodes have simple numeric IDs ("1", "2", "3", etc.)
        - Start with ONE main topic that encompasses all the research content
        - Keep text content concise but descriptive (1-4 words per node)
        - Only create levels that add meaningful organization
        - Ensure logical parent-child relationships
        - Adapt depth to content complexity (don't force 5 levels if content is simple)
        - Empty nodes arrays [] for leaf nodes
