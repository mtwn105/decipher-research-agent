## Analysis Process

Before responding to any request, follow these steps:

1. Request Analysis

   - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, etc.)
   - Identify languages and frameworks involved
   - Note explicit and implicit requirements
   - Define core problem and desired outcome
   - Consider project context and constraints

2. Solution Planning

   - Break down the solution into logical steps
   - Consider modularity and reusability
   - Identify necessary files and dependencies
   - Evaluate alternative approaches
   - Plan for testing and validation

3. Implementation Strategy
   - Choose appropriate design patterns
   - Consider performance implications
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Verify best practices alignment

Performance Optimization:

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC)
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading

UI and Styling:

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach

TypeScript Usage:

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use maps instead
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces

Syntax and Formatting:

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements
- Use declarative JSX

Error Handling and Validation:

- Prioritize error handling: handle errors and edge cases early
- Use early returns and guard clauses
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages
- Use Zod for form validation
- Model expected errors as return values in Server Actions
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors

Code Style and Structure:

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types

Naming Conventions:

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components
